## Installing

To use this package:

Run this command:

```yaml
flutter pub add flutter_intl_phone_field
```

Or, add the following to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_intl_phone_field: ^<latest_version>
```

Sometimes you may want to use the latest version of the package, instead of a published version. To do that, use the `git` syntax:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_intl_phone_field:
    git:
      url: git://github.com/rvndsngwn/flutter_intl_phone_field.git
      ref: main
```

## How to Use

Simply create a `IntlPhoneField` widget, and pass the required params:

```dart
IntlPhoneField(
    decoration: InputDecoration(
        labelText: 'Phone Number',
        border: OutlineInputBorder(
            borderSide: BorderSide(),
        ),
    ),
    initialCountryCode: 'IN',
    onChanged: (phone) {
        print(phone.completeNumber);
    },
)
```

Use `initialCountryCode` to set an initial Country Code.

## Validation

The package provides built-in validation for phone numbers. You can use the `isValidNumber()` method to check if a phone number is valid:

```dart
IntlPhoneField(
    decoration: InputDecoration(
        labelText: 'Phone Number',
        border: OutlineInputBorder(
            borderSide: BorderSide(),
        ),
    ),
    initialCountryCode: 'GB', // United Kingdom
    validator: (phoneNumber) {
        if (phoneNumber == null || phoneNumber.number.isEmpty) {
            return 'Please enter a phone number';
        }
        if (!phoneNumber.isValidNumber()) {
            return 'Please enter a valid phone number';
        }
        return null;
    },
    onChanged: (phone) {
        print(phone.completeNumber);
    },
)
```

The validator checks the phone number length against the selected country's min and max length requirements. For example:
- United Kingdom (GB): 10 digits
- Guernsey (GG): 6 digits
- United States (US): 10 digits
